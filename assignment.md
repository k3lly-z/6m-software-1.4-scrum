## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. In your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
By implementing Scrum, we will be able to satisfy the users of the IT infrastructure more quickly and react to their requests more frequently. One of the pillar of Scrum is Adaptation, meaning that the all work on the IT infrastructure can be adjusted to fit user needs as soon as possible. In addition, this also means that value can be delivered frequently to the users, as work happens in Sprints, which take place in short periods of weeks or months. This working process allows for the school and the IT team to collaborate together frequently so as to build an IT infrastructure which fits the school's needs.

This is in contrast to the more traditional Waterfall method of project management, where the projects is broken down into different phases of work, with each phase completing before the next phase begins. There are disadvantages to this method, including, not being adapatable to changing requirements. As a school may experience changing requirements, being subjected to changes in policy, operational needs, manpower, technology and etc., project requirements frequently change even when work begins. The unadaptable nature of a Waterfall method means the end product may not meet the newer requirements of the school. This results in abortive work, when teams do not adapt to the changing requirements of the project.

Scenario 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1. As a reader, I want to browse books available currently in the library, so that I can see what books I want to borrow.
2. As a reader, I want to reserve books that are currently being borrowed, so that I can queue to borrow a book even when it is currently unavailable.
3. As a reader, I want to add a book to my wishlist, so that I can decide to borrow it at a future date.
4. As a reader, I want to receive recommendations on books, so that I can discover new books I may enjoy reading.
5. As a reader, I want to make payment on the website, so that I can conveniently make payment for my late payments and other charges.
6. As a librarian, I want to view the list of books currently on loan, so that I can manage my library inventory.
7. As a librarian, I want to edit the list of books in the library database, so that I can update the list of books available in the library.
8. As a librarian, I want to collect payment through the website, so that I can collect late payments and other charges.
9. As a librarian, I want to post book recommendations on the website, so that I can recommend readers on latest books or underappreciaed books.
10. As a librarian, I want to organize books by categories, so that I can manage the inventory of books in the library.
